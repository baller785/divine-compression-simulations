# The Divine Compression Hypothesis

This repository contains the complete scientific protocols, simulation code, and empirical results supporting the Divine Compression Hypothesis ‚Äî a theory proposing that our universe is the simplest computable structure that supports emergence and observer-viable complexity.

## üß† Core Thesis

We posit that our universe is not random, but compressibly optimized. This principle is testable: real-world data (e.g. the CMB, DNA) should exhibit greater symbolic compressibility than matched stochastic simulations. This repository enables full reproduction of those tests.

# Symbolic Universe Simulation

This repository simulates symbolic universes based on entropy and complexity,
computes an emergence score, and outputs the results in CSV format.

## Description

Each universe is defined by two properties:

- **Complexity**: Simulated using an exponential distribution.
- **Entropy**: Simulated using a normal distribution.

Emergence is computed using a symbolic emergence function:
```
E(Œ≥) = exp(-complexity / 200) * exp(-((entropy - 2.5)^2) / 4)
```

## How to Run

```bash
python simulate_universes.py
```

This will generate 10 CSV files, each with 1 million simulated universes.

## Requirements


- numpy
- pandas
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- scipy
